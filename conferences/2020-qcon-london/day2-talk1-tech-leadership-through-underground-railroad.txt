# Leadership Lesson 1
  Prepare your incentives before you need them.
  This forces you to think about what are the right incentives for your team.

# Leadership Lesson 2
  Bold Actions set the Tone

  Examples on how to "fix" quickly a org/team problem by setting the tone with a bold action.
  Example: "standup meetings that are sit-downs that take >40mins" -> removed the chairs from the meeting room to trigger a change.

# Leadership Lesson 3
  Don't let your experience bias You.

  Don't do things that you are very confortable with but might:
    - not be the best for the team/project
    - unfamiliar and 'risky' or hard to your team/project

# Leadership Lesson 4
  Embrace Continuous Solving

  Don't frett about repeat problems or re-ocurrences, that is just garanteed to happen.
  Keep "solving" them and repeat the solving exercise..

# Leadership Lesson 5

  Be confortable letting the team take on the problems and create solutions
