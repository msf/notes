This is mostly about a specific experience of a company using GitHub and marketplace to improve their CI/CD

by Sonya Moisset, security engineer

she's going over some attacks that are very visible to the world, wannacry, sextorsion, ashley madison, phising attacks.etc..

now about databreaches..how they happen

attacks through scripts that are embedded on sites, because npm/js land has so many deps.. you can target them and try to inject code there. some clueless devs will really accept github PRs that hide security trojan horses.

a cool story of social engineering to gain access to npm packages hosted on github to inject malware/attacks.

my note:-- the problem isn't really npm or js, it just shows there because the SIZE of the community/usage of JS is so large, so large attack surface.

now about OWASP
it publishes the top10 proactive controls
    this is very usefull and we should track it.

Pride London Open Source Project.

they use circleci, github, github marketplace, github actions

use: Gatsby, contentful, webhooks, gatsby cloud for build, netlifly, circleci, codecov,
    .... this isn't a good talk ....

this is a walk around what they use ...

so, yes, I know security is a problem and I know about known attack vectros
yes, there are lots of tools to use for a full blown application ci/cd.
very unstructured on the type of tools and for what purpose

LGTM - automated security reviews
datree - compliance
